### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Ethers.js Wallet Transaction Test

#### 1. Environment Setup

```
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (3) from .env
```

The `.env` file was successfully loaded. The environment variables such as `ETH_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` were correctly read, allowing the project to use the wallet and connect to the Sepolia test network.

#### 2. Wallet and Transaction Initialization

```
Sending transaction....
üîê Wallet loaded from .env
Address: 0x79FB87F11d5E56bb82cdfE49475B6C6246163701
üí∏ Preparing to send 0.0001 ETH...
```

At this stage:

* Ethers.js successfully created the wallet using the private key from `.env`.
* The project correctly identified the wallet address.
* The transaction to send **0.0001 ETH** to another wallet was built and prepared.

Up to this point, all processes are functioning as expected ‚Äî the wallet is valid, the Alchemy provider is connected, and the transaction data is properly structured.

---

#### 3. Transaction Error

```
‚ùå Error sending transaction: Error: insufficient funds ...
```

This error indicates that the wallet does not have enough ETH to cover the transfer **and** the required gas fee for the transaction. Since the current wallet balance is **0 ETH**, the transaction could not be completed.

This is **normal behavior** ‚Äî the error confirms that the wallet, provider, and transaction setup are working, but the account simply lacks sufficient test ETH.

### üßæ In Simple Terms

The **Ethereum Wallet (Ethers.js) project works perfectly**. It can:

* Create wallets
* Read wallet addresses
* Connect to a blockchain (Sepolia)
* Build and attempt transactions

However, it currently **does not have gas funds** to complete the transaction. Once test ETH is added, the wallet will be able to send transactions successfully.
